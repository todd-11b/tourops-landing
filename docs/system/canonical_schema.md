# TourOps - Canonical Schema

**Schema Contract:** 4
**Doc Revision:** r07 (2026-03-03)
**Created:** 2026-02-14
**Status:** APPROVED — Schema Contract 4 Active
**Owner:** Todd Abrams (System Owner)
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for all system fields, values, and tags
**Scope:** All TourOps systems (Voice AI + Conversation AI)
**Schema Version Field:** `tourops_schema_version = 4`
**Companion Docs:** TourOps_Conversation_Design_Standard, TourOps_GHL_Platform_Capabilities, TourOps_GHL_Implementation_Recipes

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **data contract** for TourOps AI.

All systems must use these exact field names, enum values, and tags. This schema works in concert with the Conversation Design Standard, which defines *how the system behaves*. This document defines *what data the system reads and writes*.

**No deviations permitted without following the change control process.**

---

## Versioning Rules

**Schema Contract** is the only contract-level version in TourOps. It changes only when:
- Field names change (add, remove, rename)
- Enum sets change (add, remove, modify values)
- Required disposition contract changes
- Entry guard precedence changes
- Handoff/suppression control semantics change

Otherwise, update **Doc Revision** only (wording, cross-links, clarifications).

**Companion documents do not carry contract versions.** The Conversation Design Standard and Implementation Recipes use doc revisions only. Schema is the single source of breaking-change authority.

**Companion doc references** must use document names only, never version numbers.

### Non-Alignment Rule

Changes to this document do not require changes to companion documents unless:
- A required field name changes
- An enum set changes
- Entry Guard precedence changes
- AI suppression semantics change

Editorial revisions, clarifications, or internal workflow refinements do not trigger cross-document updates.

---

## Critical Rules

**DO:**
- Use exact field names as specified
- Use exact enum values as specified
- Reference this doc before any system change
- Stamp all required disposition fields at the end of every conversation

**DO NOT:**
- Create new fields without approval
- Rename existing fields
- Add new enum values without a schema version bump
- Use aliases, abbreviations, or free text where enums are defined
- Create tags that control AI behavior; suppression is controlled only by `tourops_work_state`

---

## 1. Schema Version

| Field Name | Type | Value | Purpose |
|------------|------|-------|---------|
| `tourops_schema_version` | Number | `4` | Identifies which version of the schema this account is running |

**Rule:** This field must be set on account setup.

---

## 2. AI Suppression & Work State

| Field Name | Type | Enum Values | Purpose |
|------------|------|-------------|---------|
| `tourops_work_state` | Dropdown | `AI_ACTIVE`, `HUMAN_ACTIVE`, `PAUSED` | Controls whether AI responds |

**Rules:**
- `AI_ACTIVE` — AI responds normally (default)
- `HUMAN_ACTIVE` — AI is suppressed; human has taken over
- `PAUSED` — AI is suppressed; no active human (administrative hold)
- This field is the **single source of truth** for AI suppression
- Tags must never be used to control AI behavior
- The AI sets `HUMAN_ACTIVE` on escalation; the operator's task completion sets it back

---

## 3. Intent & Routing Fields

| Field Name | Type | Enum Values | Purpose |
|------------|------|-------------|---------|
| `tourops_intent_bucket` | Dropdown | `ReadyToBook`, `Discovery`, `DayOf`, `ReservationChange`, `Corporate`, `Complaint`, `Other` | Primary intent classification |
| `tourops_intent_detail` | Text | Free text | Required when intent_bucket = Other |

---

## 4. Lifecycle Stage

| Field Name | Type | Enum Values | Purpose |
|------------|------|-------------|---------|
| `tourops_lifecycle_stage` | Dropdown | `New`, `Engaged`, `LinkSent`, `Booked`, `ActiveToday`, `AtRisk`, `Lost`, `Corporate` | Where contact is in the journey |

---

## 5. Open Loop

| Field Name | Type | Enum Values | Purpose |
|------------|------|-------------|---------|
| `tourops_open_loop` | Dropdown | `NONE`, `NEED_DATE`, `NEED_GROUP_SIZE`, `NEED_BOOKING_DETAILS`, `NEED_RESPONSE` | What's missing to move forward |

---

## 6. Outcome & Next Best Action

| Field Name | Type | Enum Values | Purpose |
|------------|------|-------------|---------|
| `tourops_outcome` | Dropdown | `LinkSent`, `CalendarBooked`, `Escalated`, `Answered`, `Abandoned`, `Voicemail`, `Spam` | What happened in this interaction |
| `tourops_next_best_action` | Dropdown | `AwaitCustomerReply`, `HumanFollowUp`, `SendReminder`, `NoAction` | What should happen next |

**Schema Contract 4 Change:** Added `CalendarBooked` to `tourops_outcome`. Used when the AI books a calendar slot (callback or consultation) instead of escalating to a human task. This is the Tier 2 outcome — between AI-resolved and human escalation.

**V6.0 Pending (Schema Contract 5):** `ConsultationBooked` and `TaskCreated` are in active use in BB production disposition workflow as more granular Tier 2 outcomes. Formal addition pending Contract 5 change control after BB proof of concept.

---

## 7. Booking & Tour Details

| Field Name | Type | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| `tourops_preferred_date` | Date | Desired tour date |
| `tourops_group_size` | Number | Number of people in party |
| `tourops_tour_type` | Dropdown | `CAT_1`, `CAT_2`, `CAT_3`, `PRIVATE` |

---

## 8. Script & Module Tracking

| Field Name | Type | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| `tourops_script_play` | Text | Which module/script was last played |
| `tourops_last_link_sent` | Text | URL of last booking link sent |
| `tourops_last_interaction_at` | Date/Time | Timestamp of most recent interaction |

---

## 9. Memory & Narrative Fields

| Field Name | Type | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| `tourops_voiceai_summary` | Text Area | Auto-generated summary of last voice interaction |
| `tourops_conversationai_summary` | Text Area | Auto-generated summary of last conversation AI interaction |

---

## 10. Grader Fields (Schema Contract 3+)

| Field Name | Type | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| `tourops_last_score` | Number | Quality score from last graded interaction (1–5) |
| `tourops_last_review_date` | Date | Date of last quality review |
| `tourops_issue_count` | Number | Number of issues detected across interactions |
| `tourops_score_notes` | Text | One-line grader reasoning for the score (e.g., "KB Usage: 2 — wrong policy") |

**Schema Contract 4 Change:** Added `tourops_score_notes`. Written by the Grader workflow to capture the top scoring issue for each interaction.

**Required Custom Values (for task assignment):**
- `ops_manager_user_id` — GHL user ID for ops manager
- `tourops_admin_user_id` — GHL user ID for admin

---

## 10b. Calendar Scheduling Fields (Schema Contract 4)

| Field Name | Type | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| `callback_scheduling_link` | Custom Value | GHL calendar booking link sent via SMS when AI offers a callback or consultation |

**Required Custom Values:**
- `callback_scheduling_link` — GHL calendar URL for operator's callback/consultation calendar

**Rules:**
- AI sends this link via SMS when a non-emergency interaction would otherwise escalate
- P0 Safety and P0b Legal always bypass calendar — immediate escalation only
- Active DayOf emergencies bypass calendar — immediate escalation only
- After calendar is booked, disposition writes `tourops_outcome = CalendarBooked`
- `tourops_work_state` stays `AI_ACTIVE` (no human handoff triggered)

---

## 10c. Operator Business Intelligence Fields

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `tourops_aov` | Custom Value | Operator's average order value in dollars — set at onboarding |
| `tourops_conversion_rate` | Custom Value | Lead-to-booking conversion rate as decimal (e.g. 0.25) — set at onboarding, default 0.25 |

**Onboarding Questions:**
1. "What is your average tour booking value?" → sets `tourops_aov`
2. "What is your current lead-to-booking conversion rate?" → sets `tourops_conversion_rate` (default: 0.25 if unknown)

**Rules:**
- Both values set per operator at onboarding — updated manually if they change
- `tourops_aov` is stamped as the **monetary value on every Opportunity** when created by workflow
- This enables native GHL revenue tracking across pipeline stages — no custom formula needed
- Est. Revenue on dashboard = Sum of open Opportunity values × `tourops_conversion_rate`
- Actual Revenue on dashboard = Sum of Booked Opportunity values (native GHL widget)

---

## 10f. Daily AI Summary — Custom Object

**Object Name:** `Daily AI Summary`
**Purpose:** Stores nightly AI proof-of-work metrics per operator. Workflow creates one record per day. Dashboard widgets read from this object.

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `date` | Date | Record date — used to filter widget to today |
| `calls_answered` | Number | Inbound calls answered by AI today |
| `messages_handled` | Number | Conversations handled by AI today |
| `links_sent` | Number | Booking links sent today (Opportunities moved to Quoted) |
| `consultations_booked` | Number | Appointments created today on AI Callback calendar |
| `est_bookings` | Number | links_sent × `tourops_conversion_rate` |

**Nightly Workflow — Proof of Work:**
1. Trigger: Scheduled daily (end of business day)
2. Count calls answered today → write to `calls_answered`
3. Count conversations handled today → write to `messages_handled`
4. Count Opportunities moved to Quoted today → write to `links_sent`
5. Count Appointments created today (AI Callback calendar) → write to `consultations_booked`
6. Calculate: `links_sent` × `{{custom_value.tourops_conversion_rate}}` → write to `est_bookings`
7. Create new `Daily AI Summary` record with today's date and all fields populated

**Dashboard Widget Config (Proof of Work section):**

| Widget Label | Source | Field/Filter | Display |
|---|---|---|---|
| Calls Answered | Daily AI Summary | calls_answered | Numeric |
| Messages Handled | Daily AI Summary | messages_handled | Numeric |
| Links Sent | Daily AI Summary | links_sent | Numeric |
| Consultations Booked | Daily AI Summary | consultations_booked | Numeric |
| Est. Bookings | Daily AI Summary | est_bookings | Numeric |
| Est. Revenue | Opportunities (native) | Sum of monetary value — open stages, this week | Currency |
| Actual Revenue | Opportunities (native) | Sum of monetary value — Booked stage, this week | Currency |

**Notes:**
- Est. Revenue and Actual Revenue use native GHL Opportunity revenue widgets — no custom object needed
- All other Proof of Work metrics come from Daily AI Summary Custom Object
- Filter for Daily AI Summary widgets: Date = Today

---

## 10d. GHL Pipeline Configuration

**Pipeline Name:** Tour Sales

| Stage | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| New Lead | Inquiry received — AI engaging |
| Quoted | AI sent pricing + booking link |
| Booked | Deposit paid — confirmed |
| Lost | Did not convert |

**Rules:**
- Only booking-intent contacts enter this pipeline
- Vendors, drivers, spam, and resolved FAQ contacts never create an Opportunity
- AI moves stage via after-call Disposition workflow actions

---

## 10e. GHL Dashboard Configuration

**Dashboard Name:** Tour Ops Command Center (set as default)

| Widget | Type | Filter | Purpose |
|--------|------|--------|---------|
| Urgent Issues | Tasks | Priority = High, Status = Open | Safety/legal escalations |
| Today's Callbacks | Appointments | Calendar = AI Callback, Date = Today | AI-scheduled consultations |
| Leads This Week | Opportunities | Date Created = Last 7 Days | New inquiry volume |

**Proof of Work Section (daily — numeric widgets):**

| Widget | Source |
|--------|--------|
| Calls Answered | Call report — today, answered |
| Messages Handled | Conversation count — today |
| Booking Links Sent | Opportunities moved to Quoted — today |
| Consultations Booked | Appointments created today — AI Callback calendar |
| Est. Bookings | Booking links sent × `tourops_conversion_rate` |
| Est. Revenue | Est. bookings × `tourops_aov` (from `tourops_daily_est_revenue`) |

---

## 11. System Tags (Visibility Only — Do NOT Use to Control AI)

| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `Human handover` | Visual indicator: human is active on this contact |
| `AI_PAUSED` | Visual indicator: AI is administratively paused |
| `BOT_TEST` | Marks contacts used for bot testing — exclude from reporting |
| `QA_TEST_CONTACT` | Marks contacts used for QA — exclude from reporting |
| `support-urgent` | Visual flag for urgent support queue |

**CRITICAL:** Tags are visibility aids only. AI suppression is controlled exclusively by `tourops_work_state`.

---

## 12. Required Disposition Contract

Every conversation must stamp these fields before closing:

### Always Required
| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| `tourops_intent_bucket` | Always set |
| `tourops_outcome` | Always set |
| `tourops_next_best_action` | Always set |
| `tourops_last_interaction_at` | Always set |
| `tourops_work_state` | Always set (default: AI_ACTIVE) |

### Conditional
| Field | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `tourops_intent_detail` | Required when intent_bucket = Other |
| `tourops_lifecycle_stage` | Update only if a qualifying lifecycle event occurred |
| `tourops_open_loop` | Update if conversation progression changed what's needed |
| `tourops_score_notes` | Written by Grader workflow after scoring |

---

## 15. KPI Derivation (Informational)

| KPI | Formula | Fields Used |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| **Call-to-Book Rate** | `Booked / ReadyToBook` | `tourops_outcome`, `tourops_intent_bucket` |
| **Discovery Conversion** | `Booked / Discovery` (over time) | `tourops_outcome`, `tourops_intent_bucket`, `tourops_lifecycle_stage` |
| **Escalation Rate** | `Escalated / Total Interactions` | `tourops_outcome` |
| **Deflection Rate** | `CalendarBooked / (CalendarBooked + Escalated)` | `tourops_outcome` |
| **SMS Engagement Proxy** | `AwaitCustomerReply after LinkSent / Total LinkSent` | `tourops_next_best_action`, `tourops_outcome` |
| **Handoff Resolution Time** | Time between `work_state = HUMAN_ACTIVE` and `work_state = AI_ACTIVE` | `tourops_work_state`, `tourops_last_interaction_at` |
| **Abandonment Rate** | `Abandoned / LinkSent` (over 48h window) | `tourops_lifecycle_stage`, `tourops_outcome` |

**Schema Contract 4 Change:** Added Deflection Rate KPI — measures how many potential escalations the AI resolved via calendar booking instead of human handoff.
