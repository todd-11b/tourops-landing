# TourOps — Build Backlog & Product Gap Tracker

**Last Updated:** 2026-03-03
**Owner:** Todd Abrams
**KPI Linkage Rule:** Every P1 item must state the KPI it impacts. No KPI = P3 or removed.
**WIP Rule:** No more than 3 active P1 items at once.
**Hygiene Rule:** Items in Planned >90 days without progress → moved to P3 or removed at monthly health check.
**Gap Rule:** If a feature is not ✅ Live, it cannot be sold as included. No exceptions.
**Consolidated from:** TO_Build_Backlog.md, TO_Product_Gap_Tracker.md

# Part 1 — Build Backlog

## Active P1 Count: 0/3

## P1 — Critical Priority

| Feature | Problem Solved | KPI Impact | Owner | Status | Target |
|---------|---------------|------------|-------|--------|--------|
| Hope V6.0 Deployment | V6.0 drafted with path architecture and KB-only URLs. Needs 19/19 regression tests + Todd sign-off before going live. V5.0 remains live until complete. | Voice AI Quality Score | Todd | Testing | ASAP after 19/19 |

## P2 — Important

| Feature | Problem Solved | KPI Impact | Owner | Status | Target |
|---------|---------------|------------|-------|--------|--------|
| Automated Regression Harness (Conv AI API) | Manual SMS/WebChat regression testing takes ~3 hours. Automation cuts to ~20 min. | Quality Score | Mike | Planned | Q3 2026 |
| Founder Cohort Operator #1 Deployment | First non-BB operator. Validates multi-operator model end-to-end. Data infrastructure inherited from reusable n8n template — per-operator setup under 20 minutes. | Call-to-Book Rate | Todd | Planned | Q2 2026 |
| Conversation AI Module Expansion — CORP | Corporate/B2B intent currently routes to escalation. Dedicated CORP module handles W-9, invoice, and group inquiry flows before handoff. | Escalation Rate | Mike | Planned | Q3 2026 |
| OP_Profile.md for all active operators | BB and live operators need persona overlay files created and confirmed. Agent_Name injected correctly, not hardcoded. | Deployment Consistency | Mike | In Progress | 2026-03-03 |

## P3 — Backlog / Future

| Feature | Problem Solved | KPI Impact | Owner | Status | Target |
|---------|---------------|------------|-------|--------|--------|
| Real-time availability check via webhook | Voice AI cannot confirm tour availability. Requires external API integration. | Call-to-Book Rate | Todd | Planned | FLAG NEEDED |
| Operator-level QA dashboard (Sheets → GHL) | QA scores tracked in Google Sheets. GHL-native view reduces ops friction. | Quality Score | Mike | Planned | Q4 2026 |
| Schema Contract 4 planning | Contract 4 may add multi-location, multi-tour-type, or revenue attribution fields. | TBD | Todd | Planned | Q4 2026 |
| Voice AI → Conversation AI handoff flow | Caller converts to SMS mid-conversation — no warm handoff between channels. | SMS Engagement Rate | Mike | Planned | Q3 2026 |

## Completed

| Feature | Completed | KPI Impact | Result |
|---------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Barley Bus → Schema Contract 3 Migration | 2026-02-28 | Voice AI Quality Score | Schema Contract 3 (r06) confirmed live in BB production. Grader fields, narrative memory, work_state all active. |
| n8n Reusable Template — GHL → Airtable | 2026-02-28 | Deployment Velocity | Per-operator data infra setup under 20 minutes. Operator name as variable. |
| Platform name-agnostic refactor (OP_Profile.md) | 2026-02-26 | Deployment Consistency | Agent persona removed from all Platform files. OP_Profile.md template created. |
| Schema Contract 3 — QA Grader Fields | 2026-02-22 | Quality Score | tourops_last_score, tourops_last_review_date, tourops_issue_count added |
| Narrative Memory Fields | 2026-02-17 | Quality Score / Context Awareness | Cross-channel memory enabled |
| GHL Auto-Summaries Integration | 2026-02-17 | Context Awareness | Conversation AI session summaries to contact notes |
| VAI Grader Workflow v1.0 | 2026-02-22 | Quality Score | Automated per-call scoring deployed |
| CAI Grader Workflow v1.0 | 2026-02-22 | Quality Score | Automated per-session scoring deployed |
| Voice Master Snapshot v1.2 | 2026-02-17 | Deployment Speed | Authoritative build guide supersedes v1.1 |
| Prompt Compiler v1.1 | 2026-02-17 | Deployment Consistency | Operator-specific prompt generation standardized |
| Voice AI Regression Test Suite v1.0 | 2026-02-14 | Quality Score | 19 RACE-format tests, 19/19 required to deploy |
| Canonical Schema Contract 2 | 2026-02-14 | All KPIs | work_state as authoritative control, lifecycle-aware model |

## FLAGS NEEDED — Blocked on Todd

| Item | What's Needed | Flagged |

| Real-time availability API | Which booking system? What endpoint? Rate limits? | 2026-02-24 |
| Schema Contract 4 scope | What business problem does it solve? What KPI? | 2026-02-24 |

## Critical Path — What to Build First

| Priority | Feature(s) | Why First | Effort | Target |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| **P0** | Operator Scorecard v0 (1.11–1.18) | Retention engine. Without it, operators can't see value. v0 = Mike sends manually Monday from GHL + Sheets. | v0: Low. v1: Med-High. | v0: now. v1: Q2 2026 |
| **P1** | 72-hour follow-up enforcement (1.7) | Conversion engine. Differentiates TourOps from "just an AI answering service." | Medium | This week |
| **P2** | Standardized onboarding templates (1.9, 2.11) | Speed to deploy new operators. Founding cohort depends on this. | Low-Med | This week |
| **P3** | Booking system integration one-way (2.1) | Unlocks entire Tier 2. Single biggest feature dependency. | High | Q3–Q4 2026 |
| **P4** | Review automation (2.4) | Strongest natural upsell trigger Tier 1 → Tier 2. | Medium | Q4 2026 |
