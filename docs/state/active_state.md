# TourOps — Active State

**Rule:** Read this at the start of every session. Update it before you close. One file, one source of truth.
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-03
**Updated By:** Todd Abrams
**Consolidated from:** TourOps_Active_State.md, TO_Governance_Conflicts_Register.md, TO_Run_Issues_Log.md

## WHERE WE ARE

**Stage:** Testing — Grader v1.0 deployed 2026-02-22. Validation overdue. Hope V6.0 drafted and pending regression tests.
**Primary Blocker:** Tim's grader validation report (OL-2) still overdue. Hope V6.0 cannot deploy until 19/19 regression tests complete.
**Next Human Decision Required:** (1) Todd go/no-go on grader validation. (2) Todd sign-off on Hope V6.0 after 19/19 pass.

## OPEN LOOPS

| # | What | Who | Due | Status |
|---|------|-----|-----|--------|
| OL-2 | Grader validation — 10 conversations, 3 manually scored, delta ≤ 0.5 | Tim | 2026-02-28 | 🔴 Overdue |
| OL-4 | Version Governance Matrix updated for Schema Contract 3 | Mike | 2026-03-07 | 🟡 Open |
| OL-7 | Airtable + n8n build | Freelancer (Upwork) | 2026-03-14 | 🟡 Pending hire |
| OL-10 | Tim + Mike onboarding emails sent (Claude project setup) | Todd | 2026-03-07 | 🟡 Draft ready — send when Tim has GitHub account |
| OL-11 | Hope V6.0 — 19/19 regression tests | Mike/Tim | ASAP | 🟡 Open — V6.0 drafted 2026-03-03, awaiting test run |

## ACTIVE CONFLICTS

| Conflict | Files | Blocking? | Owner | Due |
|----------|-------|-----------|-------|-----|
| Version Governance Matrix references Contract 2; production is on Contract 3 | Version_Governance_Matrix vs. canonical_schema.md r06 | No | Mike | 2026-03-07 |

**Resolved Conflicts:**
- 2026-02-28: BB overlay files referenced Schema Contract 2 in headers — resolved when Todd confirmed Contract 3 fields already live in BB production. Documentation-only gap.
- 2026-02-28: Duplicate conflicts registers (two versions) — resolved by consolidating into single file.

**Conflict Rules:**
- 🔴 Active/Blocking: Two docs give contradictory instructions affecting production → work stops, Todd resolves immediately
- 🟡 Open/Non-blocking: Docs out of sync but no production harm → resolve within 7 days
- Flag when: two files contradict on same topic, a production change makes a doc inaccurate, schema version changes but companion docs still reference old version

---

## BUILD STATE

**Focus:** Grader v1.0 validation (VAI + CAI)
**Done:** Schema Contract 3 live in BB production. BB overlay files corrected.
**Blocked on:** Tim's validation report (OL-2)
**Next build action after unblock:** Airtable + n8n infrastructure (freelancer)

---

## GOVERNANCE STATE

Stable. Two items in flight — matrix update (Mike, non-blocking) and infrastructure build (freelancer). No Tier 0/1 conflicts active.

---

## OPERATORS

**Barley Bus**
- Status: Live in production
- Schema: Contract 3 (r06) — confirmed live 2026-02-28

## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

**Session start:** Read this file. Note the current stage, open loops, and active conflicts before doing anything.
**Session end:** Update open loops (close what's done), add new decisions, note any new conflicts.
**New operator goes live:** Add a new `## Operator: [Name]` section.
**Closing a loop:** Remove from Open Loops, note resolution in Decisions Log.

**This file does NOT replace:** Schema contracts, platform rules, prompt files, regression suites. Those stay as standalone files. This file is only for what's actively moving.
