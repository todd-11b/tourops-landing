## WHERE WE ARE (Read First)

**Stage:** V6.0 GHL build active in BB production. Steps 1–5 of 9 complete. After-call workflow (step 6) in progress. Schema Contract 4 live. Google Sheets integration mapped.
**Primary Blocker:** Complete V6.0 GHL build (steps 6–9). Then wire Grader → Google Sheets and run end-to-end test.
**Next Human Decision Required:** Confirm `vai_outcome` values align with Sheets summary formulas (OL-16). Then complete remaining build steps and test one full call through the pipeline.

## GOVERNANCE STATE

**Schema Contract 4 approved and documented.** Changes:
- `CalendarBooked` added to `tourops_outcome` enum
- `tourops_score_notes` field added (grader reasoning)
- `callback_scheduling_link` custom value added (calendar booking link)
- Deflection Rate KPI added

Updated docs: canonical_schema.md (r07), barley_bus.md, conversation_design.md (r11)

**Schema Contract 5 (pending):** `ConsultationBooked` and `TaskCreated` outcome values are in active use in BB production disposition workflow. Formal change control after BB proof of concept.

## WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT REPLACE

Schema contracts, platform rules, prompt files, regression suites — those stay as standalone files in project knowledge. They don't change often. This file is only for what's actively moving.
