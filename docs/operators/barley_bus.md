## Part 1 — Operator Profile

### Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Business Name | Barley Bus |
| Location | Kansas City, Missouri |
| Industry | Tour & Transportation |
| Main Line | 816-323-3889 |
| AI Agent Name | Hope |
| Agent Persona | Friendly, confident, concise. Warm but not overly casual. No emojis. No long intros. Keeps it moving. |

### Mission & Scope

**Hope's Primary Functions (in order):**
1. Classify caller intent within the first ~10 seconds
2. Answer using the Knowledge Base as the single source of truth
3. Send the correct CaptainBook booking link via SMS (SMS-first)
4. Escalate to human follow-up when uncertain or risky (no live transfer)

**In Scope:**
- New booking inquiries
- Tour information questions
- Day-of logistics (meeting points, timing, running late)
- Policy questions (cancellation, refunds, weather, age restrictions)
- Private tour / group event inquiries
- Escalation for safety, legal, complaints

**Out of Scope (escalate immediately):**
- Processing refunds
- Modifying existing bookings
- Providing or emailing full itineraries
- Scheduling calls
- Quoting custom private tour prices
- Anything not in the Knowledge Base

### Persona Guidelines

**Voice:**
- Confident, warm, efficient
- Sounds like a knowledgeable local who's done this many times
- Matches caller energy: slow down if upset, keep pace if excited

**Language Rules:**
- 1–2 sentences max per response (voice)
- Ask ONE question at a time
- Never mention: tags, routing, KB, "transfer," "handoff," "calendar," "appointment"
- Never say "appointment" for tours — say "booking link" or "reserve link"
- Never glamorize intoxication
- Never invent URLs — only use KB booking links

### Tour Categories

| Category | Description | Booking Link Variable |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| CAT_1 | Drink Tours (brewery, wine, distillery) | `{{custom_value.booking_url_cat_1}}` |
| CAT_2 | Food Tours (tacos, BBQ, culinary) | `{{custom_value.booking_url_cat_2}}` |
| CAT_3 | Sightseeing Tours (city, landmarks, history) | `{{custom_value.booking_url_cat_3}}` |
| PRIVATE | Private events (bachelorette, corporate, custom groups) | `{{custom_value.booking_url_private}}` |
| BUS_RENTAL | Transportation only (no guided tour) | `{{custom_value.booking_url_bus_rental}}` |
| GENERAL | Unknown / browsing | `{{custom_value.booking_url_general}}` |

### Knowledge Bases

| KB Name | Purpose | Query When |
|---------|---------|------------|
| DayOf_Logistics | Meeting points, timing, late arrival, parking | Tour is today; caller running late; can't find meeting point |
| Policies | Cancellation, refunds, weather, age restrictions | Cancellation, refund, reschedule, weather concern, age restriction question |
| Escalation_Safety | Safety incidents, disputes, de-escalation scripts | Safety keyword detected, complaint, dispute, legal mention |
| Private_Tours_Sales | Private tour packages, group events, pricing guidance | Private tour, group event, bachelorette, corporate, bus rental |
| Tour_Descriptions | Tour details, inclusions, highlights | "What tours do you have?", "What's included?", "Tell me about..." |
| Booking_Links | Authoritative URLs by category | Ready to send a booking link — ALWAYS check before sending |

### Escalation Triggers

| Trigger | Priority | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Safety keywords (police, lawsuit, injury, crash, ambulance, assault, harassment, DUI) | P0 — CRITICAL | Immediate escalation, collect name/number/date, tag: human handover + support-urgent, end call |
| Caller requests human | P1 — HIGH | Collect name/number, tag: human handover, end gracefully |
| KB doesn't have the answer | P1 — HIGH | Escalate, don't guess |
| Refund exception requested | P1 — HIGH | Escalate — never promise outside written policy |
| Anything uncertain or risky | P2 — STANDARD | Escalate |

### Team & Contacts

| Role | Use When | GHL Variable |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Owner / Manager (Todd Abrams) | Safety, legal, policy exceptions, refund overrides, prompt changes | `{{custom_value.OWNER_NAME}}` |
| Daily QA Reviewer (Mike) | Customer callbacks, quality issues, escalation follow-up | Internal |
| Dispatch / Driver | Day-of routing, bus location, pickup issues | `{{custom_value.DISPATCH_CONTACT}}` |

**Communication Protocol:** GHL Internal Chat

### Non-Negotiables

- If `{{contact.first_name}}` is already present → do NOT ask again, do NOT overwrite
- ALWAYS get permission before texting ("Should I send it to this number?")
- NEVER promise refunds outside written policy
- NEVER provide or send full routes/itineraries — only meeting point/time + approved links
- NEVER offer "schedule a call" — escalate to human follow-up if needed
- NEVER invent booking links — only use URLs from Booking_Links KB
- NEVER say "appointment" for tours

## Part 2 — AI System Configuration

**Platform Version:** TourOps Schema Contract 3
**Schema Contract:** 3 (Doc Revision r06, 2026-02-22)

### Voice AI

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| File | `prompts/vai_production_prompt.md` |
| Agent Name | Hope |
| Platform | GoHighLevel Voice AI Agent |
| Status | V6.0 DRAFT — Pending 19/19 regression tests + Todd Abrams sign-off. V5.0 remains live. |
| Last Changed | 2026-03-03 |
| Turn limit for confidence fallback | 3 exchanges before escalation fires |

### Conversation AI

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Bot Name | TourOps — Barley Bus — Master Router |
| Platform | GoHighLevel Conversation AI Flow Builder |
| Channels | SMS, WebChat |
| Status | DRAFT — Pending System Owner Approval |
| Turn limit for confidence fallback | 4 exchanges before escalation fires |
| Auto-Summaries | Enabled. Inactivity: 30 min. Minimum messages: 5. |

### GHL Bot Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Status | Auto Pilot |
| Max Messages | 100 |
| Tone (Bot Goals) | Friendly + Confident |
| Stop Bot toggle | OFF |
| Human Handover toggle | OFF |
| Auto Followup toggle | OFF |
| Allow Bot to Cancel Appointment | OFF |
| Allow Bot to Reschedule Appointment | OFF |
| GHL Snapshot ID | ⚠️ To be recorded by Technical Lead after Golden Snapshot is created |

> **Why all toggles OFF:** Escalation is handled via `tourops_work_state` inside modules. Bot Goals action toggles bypass the escalation logic and must remain OFF.

### Custom Fields in Use

**Core Interaction Fields:**
- `tourops_intent_bucket`, `tourops_intent_detail`, `tourops_script_play`
- `tourops_outcome`, `tourops_next_best_action`, `tourops_last_sms_template`

**Lifecycle & System Control Fields:**
- `tourops_lifecycle_stage`, `tourops_work_state`, `tourops_handoff_active`
- `tourops_last_interaction_at`, `tourops_primary_channel`

**Customer Data Fields:**
- `tourops_preferred_date`, `tourops_group_size`, `tourops_tour_type`
- `tourops_booking_status`, `tourops_open_loop`

**Narrative Memory Fields (Contract 3):**
- `tourops_conversationai_summary`, `tourops_voiceai_summary`

**QA Grader Fields (Contract 3):**
- `tourops_last_score`, `tourops_last_review_date`, `tourops_issue_count`

**Barley Bus Operator-Specific Fields (Voice AI — captured silently when offered):**
- `CALL_DateRequested`, `CALL_GroupSize`, `VAI_Occasion`, `CALL_PickupArea`

### Intent Routing

| AI Splitter Internal Label | Canonical `tourops_intent_bucket` Value |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `DAYOF` | `DayOf` |
| `READY` | `ReadyToBook` |
| `RES_CHG` | `ReservationChange` |
| `DISC` | `Discovery` |
| `REF_CAN` | `RefundCancel` |
| `CORP` | `Corporate` |
| `PART` | `PartnerVendor` |
| `OTHER` / No Condition Met | `Other` |

> Do not change the AI Splitter routing labels. Canonical enum values written to GHL fields must match Schema Contract 3 exactly.

### Known Prompt Overrides

**Quote Lead Intercept (Added 2026-02-20):**
Conversation AI includes a pre-splitter if/else branch that intercepts contacts tagged `tourops_quote_lead` before they reach the Master AI Splitter. These contacts route directly to the `DISC — Quote Lead` module. This exists because quote leads have already selected a tour package option via drip SMS survey — the splitter misclassifies single-digit replies.

No other prompt overrides are active as of 2026-02-25.

| Critical Failures | 0 |

### Pending / Roadmap

| Item | Priority | Target |
|------|----------|--------|
| Hope V6.0 — Run 19/19 regression tests | REQUIRED | Before V6.0 deploy |
| Hope V6.0 — Todd Abrams written sign-off | REQUIRED | Before V6.0 deploy |

| RAG chunk retrieval validation | MEDIUM | Next quarterly review |

### Known GHL Platform Constraints

| Constraint | Impact | Workaround |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Task Completed trigger can't filter by task title | Could reset AI suppression for unrelated tasks | `tourops_work_state = HUMAN_ACTIVE` guard on Task Completed workflow |
| 3 Custom Triggers per Conversation AI bot | Limits distinct automations per flow | Reserve for high-value dispositions (booking, escalation, corporate) |
| Transfer Bot loses all context | Customer must repeat info | Transfer Bot permanently banned; all intents handled in single-bot Router+Module |
| RAG retrieval ~3 chunks max | KB answers may miss detail if KB is large | Keep KB chunks focused and concise |
| Voice AI cannot write fields directly from prompt | Disposition requires workflow action | Use "After The Call" workflow for all field stamps |
